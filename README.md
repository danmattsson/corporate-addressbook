corporate-addressbook
=====================

The Global Address List (GAL) lookup available on Android is limited in functionality. It only looks up the email address and does not provide other information that is available in the GAL. This application looks up the GAL and returns ALL data that is available on the Exchange server for the query.

Download the app from the [Android Marketplace](https://market.android.com/details?id=net.vivekiyer.GAL)
